Here's the place for articles for all ecofunctor topics:
- mathematics: category theory, algebra, etc.
- computer science: compilers, os kernels, etc.

In contrast to the blog posts, the articles here are more like textbooks and better organized for learning.

## Structure
For **mathematics**, the articles are written as a typical math textbook style, namely definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples, and also motivations and backgrounds before definitions.

For **computer science**, the articles are written as:
- backgrounds
- designs
- implementations
However, if the topic is more theoretical, it's closer to mathematics style.

## learning progress
The content for each topic/page takes 1 or 2 months to learn, and we try to fit it into a single page. Please click the sidebar to visit each topic.
