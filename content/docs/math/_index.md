Here's the information about advanced mathematics topics, including category theory, algebra, and more. The word "advanced" merely indicates the topics requires some mathematical maturity.

## styles
The styles of the articles are inspired by the book "Homotopy Type Theory". Each article is structured as follows:
- Motivations and backgrounds
- Definitions
- Theorems and proofs
- Examples, Remarks

Specifically, mathematical objects like definitions, theorems are quoted as 
> Definition ...
> A is consisted of ...

or in code blocks:
```
Definition of A:
A is consisted of ...
```

formulas are written in LaTeX style:
$$
\\\\
A = \pi r^2
\\\\
Hom_{grp}(A,F(B)) \cong Hom_{set}(U(A),B)
\\\\
f: Int \to Int
\\\\
f := x \to x^2
$$ 

or inline as $A = \pi r^2$.
