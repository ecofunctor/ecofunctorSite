## About

Ecofunctor is a research center for ecology, mathematics and computer science, and philosophy about public ownership, post-capitalism theories like Marxism, Anarchism, and Lacanian/Zizikian theory. The current capitalistic paradigm is boring and stagnant, we'd like to build something new without emphasizing profit as capitalism does, thus entering an unknown territory.
