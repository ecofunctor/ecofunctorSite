## About

Ecofunctor is a research project for ecology, mathematics and computer science, and philosophy about public ownership, post-capitalism theories like Marxism, Anarchism, and Lacanian/Zizikian theory. The current capitalistic paradigm is boring and stagnant, we'd like to build something new without emphasizing profit as capitalism does, thus entering an unknown territory. 


The purpose of this project could be anything but profit(setting the profitability as goal renders the project unnecessary):
- improvement of critical thinking via Lacanian/Zizikian/Schopenhauer theories, together with abstract mathematics, to lift analytical skills to a unseen height
- daoism, and other eastern pantheist philosophies which emphasize the whole, and combine with modern reductionist thinking
- cooperative economy rather than private ownership to lift economy out of just profit maximization.
- no single value measurement(like money, GDP, efficiency), but analysis from multiple dimensions, intuitions and emotions
- decentralized, everyone shall took part, and even start their own similar projects


Currently the project is focusing on bringing the gap between normal audience and difficult topics in several fields, like abstract mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, by providing a wiki-like website for easy access and reading, with the mindset of mathematical rigor and clarity.

## About this site
This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed via github actions to github pages.

The theme is a fork of [Compose](https://github.com/doofin/hugo-docs-theme), with customizations like mathjax support.
