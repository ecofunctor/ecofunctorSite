After returning from the captialistic tech industry, and recently being inspired by the work of Zizek, I decided to embark on a journey of open research about a mixture of topics that interest me, including abstract mathematics, ecology and philosophy.

The current dominant worldview, not limited to capitalism, seems to have wrongly assumed that there exists something optimal and absolute. This basic assumption has led to extreme pursuit of efficiency and optimization, and money(capital accumulation). According to Zizek, the fullfillment of desires is the blind pursuit of human beings, but it'
s the process that matters, not the goal itself. In this sense, the current capitalist system is fundamentally flawed, as it focuses solely on the end goal of profit maximization. 

Another assumption is to assume that objects in the world are independent and isolated, so individual analysis is sufficient, and to apply reductionism everywhere from natural sciences to social sciences like human resources management. The flaw is multifold: first, the world is fundamentally interconnected and relational, as shown by quantum physics and ecology. The illusion of independence comes from our limited perception and observation tools.
Second, reductionism often leads to oversimplification and loss of important information, especially in complex systems like human societies.

The essence of reductionism seems to be mathematical formalism, and many pitfalls arise from abusing it for complex systems, thus being misled by the non-essence of reductionism. Again, reductionism arises from monotheistic thinking, assuming a single central controlling entity, which is fundamentally flawed. However, reductionism is widely successful in many fields, where surgery level precision is advantageous, in the era of modern industrialization. 

As the incessant expansion of capitalism leads to overfullment of human desires, it doesn't answer the fundamental question of what exactly is desire, and what is the purpose, aside from endless accumulation of wealth and power. Not only the environmental crisis, but also the mental health crisis, where people lost desire itself, are rooted deeper beyond mere medical or technical issues, thus unable to be solved the methodologies of separation of variables, the prominent method in reductionism. For example:
- Depression is often modeled as a chemical imbalance in the brain, but this ignores the social isolation and lack of purpose.
- Current methods of treating ecological crisis focus on technical advancements, like renewable energy, but never mention alternatives like degrowth, or reducing consumption.
- Food shortage is often attributed to lack of supply, but there's huge food waste and unequal distribution. If the rich consume soy beans instead of meat, the inequality will be alleviated.

Not to misunderstand this post as trying to be ethically superior, the current worldview is just fundamentally boring, and people are bound to a specific job without freedom for alternatives interests and curiosities. The essence of life shall be the process of exploring possibilities, not optimizing for a specific goal. What happens if Musk lives forever and occupies all the universe? It would be the ultimate boredom, perhaps he would hope a enemy shows up to amuse him.

The current AI hype, causing massive price surges in RAM and electricity, is also funny. Capitalist invested heavily in AI, frenziedly building AI data centers, but seems to ignore that AI needs to be used by humans to be useful, and profitable. 

The readers might feel the Nilhilistic(nothing matters) tone in this post, but it's the opposite: everything matters, but not in the sense of 
profit maximization or efficiency. However, Nilhilism is the steps to take, which is the negation of the current worldview. It's actually the negation of Nilhilism that provides new insights, which is the double negation of the status quo. This is also interesting in intuitionistic logic, where double negation is different from the original statement, unlike classical logic.


The readers might also wonder why I mix ecology, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy together. The reason is that these fields are fundamentally interconnected, and cannot be fully understood in isolation. Ecology studies the relationships between organisms and their environment, which is inherently complex and dynamic. Mathematics provides the tools to model and analyze complex systems, while computer science offers the means to simulate and visualize these systems. Philosophy provides the framework to question the underlying assumptions and values that guide our understanding of the world.


In contrast, Daoism, an ancient Chinese philosophy, emphasizes the interconnectedness thus in harmony with the mindset of ecology and complex systems. Perhaps, that's one reason why China has arisen in a reductionist world dominated by Western thinking. The reductionist approach adopted in full lead to low efficiency and bureaucracy, according to my experience working in a big tech company in Norway. Everyone is specialized in a narrow field, and communication is difficult. On the other hand, the East approach, emphasizing more from the pragmatics and sacrificing some precision, leads to unique advantages.
