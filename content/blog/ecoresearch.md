After returning from the captialistic tech industry, and recently being inspired by the work of Zizek, I decided to embark on a journey of open research about a mixture of topics that interest me, including programming languages, category theory, topology, and theoretical computer science.

The current dominant worldview, not limited to capitalism, seems to have wrongly assumed that there exists something optimal and absolute. This basic assumption has led to extreme pursuit of efficiency and optimization, and money(capital accumulation). According to Zizek, the fullfillment of desires is the blind pursuit of human beings, but it'
s the process that matters, not the goal itself. In this sense, the current capitalist system is fundamentally flawed, as it focuses solely on the end goal of profit maximization. 

Another assumption is to assume that objects in the world are independent and isolated, so individual analysis is sufficient, and to apply reductionism everywhere from natural sciences to social sciences like human resources management. The flaw is multifold: first, the world is fundamentally interconnected and relational, as shown by quantum physics and ecology. The illusion of independence comes from our limited perception and observation tools.
Second, reductionism often leads to oversimplification and loss of important information, especially in complex systems like human societies.
